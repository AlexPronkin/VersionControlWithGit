We're riding down the boulevard
We're riding through the dark night, night
With half the tank and empty heart
Pretending we're in love,
but it's never enough, nah
As the sirens fill the lonely air
Oh, how did we get here
now now now babe
We see a storm is closing in
Pretending we ain't scared

[Chorus:]
Don't say a word while we dance with the devil
You brought a fire to a world so cold
We're out of time on the highway to never
Hold on (hold on), hold on (hold on)
Don't say a word while we dance with the devil
You brought a fire to a world so cold
We're out of time on the highway to never
Hold on (hold on), hold on (hold on)

We're running all the red lights down
No way that we can stop, nah nah
A quarter tank and almost gone
Pretending we're in love,
but it's never enough, nah
I wish we could take it back in time
Before we crossed the line,
now now now, babe
We see a storm is closing in
I reach out for your hand

Don't say a word while we dance with the devil
You brought a fire to a world so cold
We're out of time on the highway to never
Hold on (hold on), hold on (hold on) (hold on)
Don't say a word while we dance with the devil
You brought a fire to a world so cold
We're out of time on the highway to never
Hold on (hold on), hold on (hold on) (hold on)

Oh oh, hold on!




Empty spaces, what are we living for?
Abandoned places, I guess we know the score, on and on
Does anybody know what we are looking for?
Another hero, another mindless crime
Behind the curtain, in the pantomime
Hold the line
Does anybody want to take it anymore?
The show must go on
The show must go on, yeah
Inside my heart is breaking
My makeup may be flaking
But my smile, still, stays on

Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance
Another heartache, another failed romance, on and on
Does anybody know what we are living for?
I guess I'm learning
I must be warmer now
I'll soon be turning, round the corner now
Outside the dawn is breaking
But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free
The show must go on
The show must go on
Inside my heart is breaking
My makeup may be flaking
But my smile, still, stays on
